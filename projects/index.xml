Introduction: The data contain informations which might have influence for people&amp;rsquo;s happiness score in the selected country. We have 5 reports divided by years, from 2015 to 2019.

These factors contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the worldâ€™s lowest national averages for each of the six factors.</description>
