<h2 id="introduction">Introduction:</h2>
<p>The data contain informations which might have influence for people&rsquo;s happiness score in the selected country.
We have 5 reports divided by years, from 2015 to 2019.</p>
<p>Acording to data, the happiness score can be estimated from six factors - economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity. These factors contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.</p>
<p>At the beginning, I considered each report separately, and then sum up my analysis into one report - summary report.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness">link to data</a></p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview:</h2>
<ol>
<li>I checked if data are completed and if there is no NaN values.</li>
<li>On the correlation maps below, we see which factor has the highest influence on happiness score and which of them has lowest. Regardless the years, the highest influence on happiness score of the country has economy level of this country. On the opposite side, the generosity factor has little effect on happiness score.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://armind93.github.io/static/images/WorldHappinessReport/corr_maps.jpg" alt="corr_maps"></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>In 2015, Switzerland was the country with the highest happiness score their citizens, but in 2016 this country took the second position in the ranking. Through the next years, Switzerland fell on the fourth, the fifth and the sixth place. In 2016, Denmark took the first place in this ranking. Unfortunately, in 2017 came on the second place, and Norway won the competion. In 2018 and 2019, Finland led in the happiness score ranking.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>Here below, we can see how the citizens happiness score has changed from 2015 to 2019. The largest increase from 2015 to 2019 had Finland. An interesting case is Austria. From 2015 to 2017, score of this country was decreasing, but in 2017 to 2019, it was start to rising. From 2015 Norway and Denmark are the countries with the highest happiness score, which hasn&rsquo;t changed rapidly to 2019.</li>
</ol>
